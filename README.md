# Project Name :  Movie Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project involves sentiment analysis on movie reviews to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) 
associated with user feedback. By utilizing natural language processing techniques and machine learning 
algorithms, the goal is to build a model that accurately classifies sentiments, aiding in understanding 
audience reactions to various movies.
